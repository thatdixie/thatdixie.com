Hi! I'm <b>Megan Williams</b>! I live in New York City and am currently a bartender. I love it because I get to meet and work with a lot of very cool people.
</p>
<p>
  But, guess what?
</p>
<p>I graduated! This January I earned a <b>Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science from Hunter Collage (GPA 3.45)</b>.
</p>
<p>
  This website is always a work in progress but, I hope to show off some of my newly acquired
  <a href="#projectshit">software development skills</a>, my <a href="/capstone/DixieResume.pdf"> resume</a> and maybe have some <a href="#funshit">Fun</a> at the same time.
</p>
<p>
  So, stay tuned to this page and send me a note by clicking the <a href="#contact">contact link!</a>&nbsp;
  <br>I'd love to hear what you think so far!
</p>
<p>
  Oh and before I forget, I think I should give a shout-out to <a target="capstone" href="http://EntityObjects.com"> EntityObjects.com</a> where I learned about <b>Object Relational Mapping (ORM)</b>
  and how to make beautiful <b>LAMP Stack</b> websites <a href="/capstone/thatdixie.php">like this one</a>!
</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my page!

<p>Love, Megan <img src="images/kiss.jpg"></p>
