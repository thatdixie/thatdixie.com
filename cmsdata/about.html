Hi! I'm <b>Megan Williams</b>! My friends call me Dixie (it's a long story ), I live in New York City and am currently a bartender. I love it because I get to meet and work with a lot of very cool people.
</p>
<p>
  I'm also a full time student and senior at Hunter college where I'm working toward a bachelors degree in Computer Science.
</p>
<p>
  This website is a work in progress. I hope to show off some of my newly acquired <a href="#portfolio">software development skills</a> and maybe have some <a href="#features">Fun</a> at the same time.
</p>
<p>
So, stay tuned to this page and send me a note by clicking the contact link! I'd love to hear what you think so far!
</p>
<p>
  Oh and before I forget, I think I should give a shout-out to <a target="shoutout" href="https://bootstrapmade.com" >bootstrapmade</a> where I stole this amazing template (no, my HTML 5 and JavaScript isnâ€™t nearly this good yet lol) but, I am currently studying some of the Javascript frameworks such as <a target="shoutout" href="https://reactjs.org/" >React</a>  and <a target="shoutout" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> -- I'm getting there!
</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my page!

<p>Love, Dixie <img src="images/kiss.jpg"></p>
